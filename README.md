# corner_case_test

This is still on going project. Constatnly updating.

But if there are need to use it. First of all clone/fork the whole project. Install requirements, it's only for nice import sorting thing. 

Please first of all start test, it could be that I have changed something during the time.

There is no CLI options, you only could pas parameters inside the main.py file.

If you see anything that could be edited, let me know.
